SQL Data Base made for a fictional cafe 

As part of a college course, I created an SQL database for a fictional scenario. Before building the SQL code, I designed logical and conceptual schemes to define the database's structure and relationships. This project enhanced my SQL skills and provided valuable experience in database design and management. It was a rewarding learning opportunity that sparked my interest in leveraging databases for practical solutions.

In the PDF below the whole documentation and data base is inserted.
I have also attached the SQL Source File
